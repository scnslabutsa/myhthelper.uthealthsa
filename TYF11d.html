</div>
<p>Children often overhear conversations. They tend to worry more if they feel that important news is being kept from them. As a parent or guardian, you may want to protect your children from distressing news, such as cancer. However, avoiding the topic may confuse children and make them fear a worst-case situation.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that children share information with each other. The whole family, including your siblings and parents, should work together to decide what and how much to tell the children about a family memberâ€™s cancer diagnosis. This can help avoid confusing or misleading information being passed among the children.</p>
