</div>
<p>Diarrhea is frequent, loose, or watery bowel movements.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled diarrhea can lead to dehydration (fluid loss), weight loss, poor appetite, and weakness, so itâ€™s very important to contact your healthcare team if your diarrhea does not get better.</p>
<p>Tips to Manage Diarrhea:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid high-fiber foods because they can make diarrhea worse. Foods high in fiber include fruit, grains and cereal, beans, nuts, and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid greasy, fried, spicy or very sweet foods because they can make diarrhea worse.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink plenty of clear, non-carbonated (no sodas!) liquids during the day. Drink your liquids at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink and eat high-sodium (salt) foods like broths, soups, sports drinks, crackers, and pretzels.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink and eat high-potassium foods like fruit juices, sports drinks, potatoes with the skin, and bananas.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day.</p></li>
</ul>
