<h1 class="title">Dry Skin</h1>
</div>
<p>Dry skin can cause itchy skin, so often they two symptoms happen together.</p>
<p>Your doctor may be able to prescribe you a topical steroid cream. Talk with your healthcare team about how severely and how often you experience dry or itchy skin.</p>
<p>Tips for Managing Dry/Itchy Skin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a moisturizing cream at least twice a day.</li>
<li>Apply an oil (such as baby oil) or cream after showering, within 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Avoid products that irritate skin (soaps, detergents, creams with fragrance/perfume or alcohol).</li>
<li>Avoid products that scratch or scrub (exfoliate) the skin (sponges, loofas, bath scrubs).</li>
<li>Shower and bathe with cool or warm water only; hot water can dry the skin even more.</li>
<li>If your skin is very dry or cracked, use moisturizers that contain the following ingredients: Salicylic acid, urea, ammonium, lactic acid. These ingredients will soften the skin and allow water to be absorbed.</li>
<li>If your skin is very itchy, use moisturizers that contain menthol, camphor, or pramoxine.</li>
</ul>
