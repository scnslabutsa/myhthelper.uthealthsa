<ul>
<li><p>Be prepared. It is often helpful to gather information about your health concerns—from the library (books and medical journals), trusted websites or fact sheets like the ones offered by Komen. The more you know, the more comfortable you will be talking to your doctor.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize your questions ahead of time. You should be able to talk openly and honestly with your doctor about breast cancer to make sure all of your questions are answered.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to write down any questions you may have. These questions will help your doctor understand and address your specific concerns. Also, be sure to bring some type of voice recorder to capture your conversation so you can refer back to it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell your story. When your doctor comes in, ask if you can take a few minutes to briefly explain your situation and concerns. Be as specific as you can. Then give the doctor your list of questions and ask them.</p></li>
<li><p>Give feedback. If your doctor’s responses were helpful, say so. This kind of feedback will encourage your doctor to talk with you, listen to you and continue to help you.</p></li>
<li><p>Doctors are just like anyone else; they want to do their job well. That means doing whatever they can to help you stay healthy or to get better. Remember, although doctors may know a great deal about breast cancer, they may not truly understand or be aware of all that you are going through. You can help your doctor help you by sharing your feelings and concerns.</p></li>
