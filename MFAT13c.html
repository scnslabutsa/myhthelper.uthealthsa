<p>When you finish treatment, you may still feel tired. Do not fight thatâ€”your body needs rest. If you are able, physical activity can help speed the recovery process after treatment.</p>
<p>Getting back to the things you used to do, even if it takes some time, will help you feel better. Adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity and a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there may come a day when you no longer worry about cancer every day. It is normal to have some anxiety though. This should lessen over time. You may be able to get support from other breast cancer survivors who are in the same place as you are now.</p>
<p>There are often support groups for people at specific stages of illness or recovery. You may find groups that are run by breast cancer survivors. These groups can be a helpful source of information and support.</p>
