<p><strong>Macrobiotics (Macrobiotic Diet)</strong><br />Integrative or complementary dietary therapy that includes a mostly vegetarian, organic food diet with certain methods of food preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (see MRI)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Malignant</strong><br />Cancerous.</p>
<p><strong>Mammary Duct (see Duct in <a href="D.html">D</a>)</strong><br /> <strong>Mammary Duct Ectasia</strong><br />A benign (not cancer) breast condition resulting from inflammation (swelling) and enlargement of the ducts behind the nipple. Often there are no symptoms, but calcifications seen on a mammogram may point to its presence. No treatment is needed if the woman is not having symptoms (burning, pain or itching in the nipple area).</p>
<p><strong>Mammary Glands</strong><br />The breast glands that produce milk.</p>
<p><strong>Mammogram</strong><br />An X-ray image of the breast.</p>
<p><strong>Margins</strong><br />The rim of normal tissue surrounding a tumor that has been surgically removed. A margin is clean (also known as uninvolved, negative or clear) if there is only normal tissue (and no cancer cells) at the edges. Clean margins show the entire tumor was removed. With involved (also known as positive) margins, normal tissue does not completely surround the tumor. This means the entire tumor was not removed and more surgery is needed to get clean margins.</p>
<p><strong>Mastectomy</strong><br />Surgical removal of the breast. The exact procedure depends on the diagnosis. See Total Mastectomy and Modified Radical Mastectomy.</p>
<p><strong>Mastitis</strong><br />An inflammation (swelling) of the breast usually occurring during breastfeeding. Symptoms include pain, nipple discharge, fever, redness and hardness over an area of the breast.</p>
<p><strong>Mean</strong><br />The average of a group of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Mean Survival Time</strong><br />The average time from the start of treatment (or diagnosis) that people in a study stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>Median</strong><br />The middle value (50th percentile) of a group of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Oncologist</strong><br />A physician specializing in the treatment of cancer using chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Melatonin</strong><br />Hormone made by the pineal gland in the brain. It is an important part of the body's internal timing system.</p>
<p><strong>Menarche</strong><br />The first menstrual period.</p>
<p><strong>Menopausal Hormone Therapy (Postmenopausal Hormone Use, Hormone Replacement Therapy)</strong><br />The use of hormone pills containing estrogen (with or without progestin) to ease symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p><strong>Menopause</strong><br />The ending of the normal menstrual cycle in women. It occurs most often in the late forties or early fifties.</p>
<p><strong>Meta-Analysis</strong><br />A method for taking the results reported in a group of studies and averaging them to come up with a single, summary result.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolized</strong><br />The chemical process whereby drugs and food are broken down by the body.</p>
<p><strong>Metastases</strong><br />Spread of cancer to other organs through the lymphatic and/or circulatory system.</p>
<p><strong>Microcalcifications</strong><br />Small, clustered deposits of calcium in the breast that may be seen on a mammogram. These may or may not be related to breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Microvascular Surgery</strong><br />Surgery that involves connecting small blood vessels.</p>
<p><strong>Modified Radical Mastectomy</strong><br />Surgical removal of the breast, the lining of the chest muscles and some of the lymph nodes in the underarm area. Used to treat early and locally advanced breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Molecular Breast Imaging (see Nuclear Medicine Imaging of the Breast in <a href="N.html">N</a>)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Monoclonal Antibodies</strong><br />Immune proteins that can locate and bind to cancer cells. They can be used alone or they can be used to deliver drugs, toxins or radioactive material directly to tumor cells. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an example of a monoclonal antibody used to treat breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Mortality Rate</strong><br />Number of deaths in a given group of people over a certain period of time.</p>
<p><strong>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)</strong><br />An imaging technique that uses a magnet linked to a computer to make detailed pictures of organs or soft tissues in the body.</p>
<p><strong>mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors</strong><br />A class of targeted therapy drugs that may increase the benefit of hormone therapy. Everolimus (Afinitor) is an example of an mTOR inhibitor.</p>
<p><strong>Multifocal Tumors (Multicentric Tumors)</strong><br />One or more tumors that develop from the original breast tumor.</p>
<p><strong>Multimodality Therapy</strong><br />Use of two or more treatment methods (such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy) in combination or one after the other to get the best results.</p>
<p><strong>Mutation (Gene Mutation)</strong><br />Any change in the DNA (the information contained in a gene) of a cell. Gene mutations can be harmful, beneficial or have no effect.</p>
