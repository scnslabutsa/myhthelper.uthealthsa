<p><strong>Fat Necrosis</strong><br />A benign (not cancer) breast change in which the breast responds to trauma with a firm, irregular mass, often years after the event. The mass is the result of fatty tissue dying, after either surgery or blunt trauma to the breast. This breast change does not increase risk of breast cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Flow Cytometry</strong><br />A laboratory test done on tumor tissue to measure the growth rate of the cancer cells and to check if the cells have too much DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)</strong><br />A laboratory test done on breast tumor tissue to find out the number of copies of the HER2/neu gene contained in the cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong>Frozen Section</strong><br />Process where a portion of tissue from a surgical biopsy is frozen so a thin slice can be studied to check for cancer. Frozen section results are only preliminary and always need to be confirmed by other methods.</p>
