<ul>
<li><p>Walk daily. There are so many ways to add walking to your daily routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you’re at work, use a bathroom that is in a different building or different floor.</li>
<li>Walk during your lunch time.</li>
<li>Walk around your neighborhood after dinner.</li>
<li>Walk your dog in the morning and before bed; if you don’t have a dog, maybe your neighbor needs help walking their dog.</li>
<li>Don’t text your children to come to the table for dinner. Walk to their rooms to tell them.</li>
<li>Park farther away from building entrances.</li>
<li>If you use the bus, get off one stop earlier.</li>
<li>If you need to go somewhere within walking distance, walk instead of drive.</li>
<li>Form a walking club with your co-workers to help you stay motivated to talk during the workday.</li>
<li>Wear a pedometer every day so that you see just how much you’re walking. Sometimes just seeing how little or how much you are walking can motivate you to walk more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ride your bike.</p></li>
<li><p>Do some yard work. Mow the grass or pull out weeds; rake leaves instead of using a leaf blower.</p></li>
<li><p>Scrub your bathroom tubs and showers.</p></li>
<li><p>Wash and wax your car.</p></li>
<li><p>Play active games with your kids, like freeze tag or jump rope.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a friend dancing or dance in your own living room.</p></li>
<li><p>Do something while you watch TV. Get light hand weights and do curls, use a stationary bike or treadmill, do squats during commercials.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.</p></li>
</ul>
