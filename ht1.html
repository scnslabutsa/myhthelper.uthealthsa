<p>Some types of breast cancer are affected by hormones in the blood. Hormones are chemical messengers that activate or control certain cells.</p>
<p><em>Breast Cancer Types</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Breast cancers with many hormone receptor cells are called hormone receptor-positive cancers. They can attach to the hormones estrogen (estrogen- positive or ER-positive) and/or progesterone (progesterone positive or PR-positive). For these cancers, high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread. About 75% of patients are diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>Breast cancers with few or no hormone receptor cells are called hormone receptor-negative cancers. They can be estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) and/or progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).</p></li>
