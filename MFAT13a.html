<h1 class="title">Follow-up Visits</h1>
</div>
<p>Your primary care doctor, oncologist or surgeon can help plan your follow-up medical care. At first, your follow-up doctor visits will probably be scheduled for every few months. The longer you have been free of cancer, the less often the appointments are needed. After 5 years, they are typically done about once a year. Follow-up visits may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical history and physical exam every 4 to 6 months for the first 5 years, then every 12 months.</li>
<li>Regular mammograms. If you had breast-conserving surgery, you will get a mammogram about 6 months after surgery and radiation are completed, and then at least every year after that. If you had a mastectomy you will still need to have yearly mammograms on the remaining breast.</li>
<li>Clinical breast exams every year, as part of your periodic health examination.</li>
<li>Pelvic exam and Pap smear every 12 months (if you are taking tamoxifen).</li>
<li>Bone density tests every 1 to 2 years (if you are at high risk of osteoporosis).</li>
</ul>
