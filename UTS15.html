<h1 class="title">Using Trusted Sources of Information</h1>
</div>
<p>Health information, in print or online, should come from trusted, credible sources.</p>
<p>Government agencies, hospitals, universities, and medical journals and books providing evidence-based information are trustworthy. Too often, other sources can provide misleading or incorrect information. If a source makes claims that are too good to be true, rememberâ€”they usually are.</p>
<p>There are many websites, books, and magazines that provide health information to the public, but not all of them are trustworthy. Please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=augrvuHd1OM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=augrvuHd1OM</a> to watch this short educational YouTube video.</p>
