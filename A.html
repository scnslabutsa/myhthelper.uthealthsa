<p><strong>Absolute Risk</strong><br />A person's chance of developing a certain disease over a certain time period. The absolute risk of a disease is estimated by looking at a large group of people similar in some way (in terms of age, for example) and counting the number of people in this group who develop the disease over the specified time period. For example, if we followed 100,000 women between the ages of 30 and 34 for one year, about 25 would develop breast cancer. This means the one-year absolute risk of breast cancer for a 30- to 34-year-old woman is 25 per 100,000 women (1 per 4,000 women).</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong><br />Use of very thin needles inserted at precise points on the body that may help control pain and other side effects of treatment or breast cancer itself. It is a type of integrative or complementary therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Adjuvant (Systemic) Therapy</strong><br />Treatment given in addition to surgery and radiation to treat breast cancer that may have spread to other parts of the body. It may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or hormone therapy. Advocacy (see Breast Cancer Advocacy)</p>
<p><strong>Alopecia</strong><br />Hair loss.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Therapy</strong><br />Any therapy used instead of standard medical treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Alternative therapies are different from integrative and complementary therapies, which are used in addition to standard treatments. Alternative therapies have not been shown to be effective in treating breast cancer, so it is not safe to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Amenorrhea</strong><br />The absence or stopping of menstrual periods.</p>
<p><strong>Anesthesia</strong><br />Loss of feeling or sensation that keeps a person from feeling pain during surgery or other medical procedures. Local or regional anesthesia may be used for a specific part of the body, such as the breast, by injection of a drug into that area. General anesthesia numbs the entire body and puts a person to sleep with drugs that are injected into a vein or inhaled.</p>
<p><strong>Aneuploid (DNA Ploidy)</strong><br />The presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong>Angiogenesis</strong><br />The growth of new blood vessels that cells need to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Antibody</strong><br />A protein made by white blood cells that is part of the body’s immune system. Each antibody binds to a certain antigen (foreign substance, such as bacteria) and helps the body fight the antigen.</p>
<p><strong>Antibody Therapy</strong><br />A drug containing an antibody that is specially made to target certain cancer cells. See Antibody.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-carcinogen</strong><br />An agent that counteracts carcinogens (cancer causing agents).</p>
<p><strong>Antiemetic</strong><br />A medicine that prevents or relieves nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Antigen</strong><br />A substance that causes the body to make an immune response. This immune response often involves making antibodies.</p>
<p><strong>Antioxidant</strong><br />A substance that protects the body from damage by oxidizing agents. Oxidizing agents are always present in the body and are often beneficial. However, when large amounts of oxidants are present in cells, they can cause damage, especially to DNA. This can lead to abnormal cell growth. Antioxidants include beta-carotene and vitamins A, C and E.</p>
<p><strong>Apoptosis</strong><br />A normal cell process in which a genetically programmed series of events leads to the death of a cell. Cancer cells may block apoptosis.</p>
<p><strong>Areola</strong><br />The darkly shaded circle of skin surrounding the nipple.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatase Inhibitors</strong><br />Hormone therapy drugs that lower estrogen levels in the body by blocking aromatase, an enzyme that converts other hormones into estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors are used to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Aspirate</strong><br />To remove fluid and a small number of cells.</p>
<p><strong>Atrophic Vaginitis</strong> (see Vaginal Atrophy in <a href="V.html">V</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Atypical Hyperplasia</strong><br />A benign (not cancer) breast condition where breast cells are growing rapidly (proliferating). The proliferating cells look abnormal under a microscope. Although atypical hyperplasia is not breast cancer, it increases the risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Autologous</strong><br />A blood donation or tissue graft from a person’s own body rather than from a donor. For example, autologous breast reconstruction techniques use skin and tissue flaps (grafts) from a person’s own body.</p>
<p><strong>Axilla</strong><br />The underarm area.</p>
<p><strong>Axillary Dissection (Axillary Sampling)</strong><br />Surgical procedure to remove some or all of the lymph nodes from the underarm area so that the nodes can be examined under a microscope to check whether or not cancer cells are present.</p>
<p><strong>Axillary Lymph Nodes</strong><br />The lymph nodes in the underarm area.</p>
<p><strong>Ayurveda</strong><br />An integrative or complementary medical system from India that involves diet, exercise, meditation and massage. Ayurveda means &quot;life-knowledge.&quot;</p>
