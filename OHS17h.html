<p>Stress is a natural part of our daily lives. When you face a stressful situation, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, and your brain uses more oxygen.</p>
<p>Tips to Reduce Stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get organized, make a schedule.</li>
<li>Use a day planner to keep track of your appointments and activities.</li>
<li>When you schedule activities, allow plenty of time to finish one activity before starting the next.</li>
<li>Schedule breaks between activities.</li>
<li>Count the time it takes to get somewhere as part of your schedule.</li>
<li>Set priorities. Make a list of the things you have to do and rank them by importance, considering importance in terms of daily life, but also in terms of personal importance to you.</li>
<li>Learn how to say no to new tasks—even practice saying “no” ahead of time. If saying “no” feels difficult, tell the person asking what you can do instead. For example, getting a task started for someone else or doing a smaller part of the task.</li>
<li>Concentrate on things you can control and avoid dwelling on problems you can’t control. Sometimes the only aspect of a problem you can control is how you react to it. Learn how to be okay with that.</li>
<li>Remind yourself about the things you have done, and not about all the things you haven’t done. Break down tasks into smaller steps; it’s easier to see progress you’re making when you can check things off along the way.</li>
<li>Ask for help from family, friends, or coworkers when you just need some extra support to get something done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips to Manage Stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise regularly. Just 30 minutes per day of moderate walking can boost your mood and reduce stress.</li>
<li>Schedule social activities. Make time to see your family and friends.</li>
<li>Schedule relaxing time. Set aside routine times to do an activity you find relaxing.</li>
<li>Do things you enjoy. Eat at your favorite restaurant (or look up the recipe for your favorite meal and try to make it at home), watch your favorite show, walk in your favorite park.</li>
<li>Laugh! Laughter reduces stress. See a funny movie, read a funny book, or look at old family videos.</li>
<li>Write in a journal. Journaling is a private way to express your feelings and is an opportunity to put your feelings into words.</li>
<li>Learn a new hobby. Trying new and challenging activities can give you a sense of accomplishment and is also a way to set time aside for yourself.<br /></li>
