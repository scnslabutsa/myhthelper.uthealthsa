<h1 class="title">Key Messages When Talking with Your Spouse/Partner</h1>
</div>
<p>When talking with your spouse or partner think about these key messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Couples often find it hard to talk about difficult or sad topics. This means that they may shy away from talking about the intense emotions and changes that come with a cancer diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk openly and honestly with your spouse or partner. It is also helpful to sensitively listen to your partnerâ€™s thoughts and feelings.</p></li>
<li><p>You should also discuss practical concerns, such as treatment options and changes in routines, and future plans.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider joining a support group or talking with a trained counselor to help you each cope in your own way.</p></li>
</ul>
