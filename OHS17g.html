</div>
<p>There are many ways people describe nausea: sick to my stomach, queasy, or upset stomach. Nausea can have other symptoms that happen at the same time, such as increased saliva, trouble swallowing, or fast heart rate. A person can have nausea with or without vomiting.</p>
<p>If nausea becomes severe, talk to your doctor. S/He may want to prescribe a medication that helps reduce nausea. However, beyond medication, there are certain things you can do to help.</p>
<p>Tips to Manage Nausea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat 6-8 snacks or small meals a day, instead of 3 large meals.</li>
<li>Eat dry foods like crackers, toast, or dry cereal, when you wake up and every few hours throughout the day.</li>
<li>Eat foods that don’t have strong smells.</li>
<li>Eat cool foods instead of hot or spicy foods.</li>
<li>Avoid foods that are greasy, fried, spicy, or very sweet.</li>
<li>Don’t eat in a room that’s warm or that has cooking odors or other smells. Cooking outside on the grill or using boiling bags can reduce cooking odors.</li>
<li>Suck on hard candy like peppermint or lemon drops if there’s a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
</ul>
