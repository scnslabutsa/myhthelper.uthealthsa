<p><strong>Naturopathy (Naturopathic Medicine)</strong><br />A medical system based on a belief in using natural elements to maintain health and to help the body heal itself. It includes therapies such as nutrition and massage.</p>
<p><strong>Needle Localization (see Wire Localization in <a href="W.html">W</a>)</strong><br /> <strong>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (Induction Chemotherapy, Primary Chemotherapy, Preoperative Chemotherapy)</strong><br />Chemotherapy used as a first treatment. Often used for large or locally-advanced cancers to shrink tumors before surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Neoadjuvant Hormone Therapy</strong><br />Hormone therapy used as a first treatment. Often used for large or locally-advanced cancers to shrink tumors before surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Neoadjuvant Therapy (Preoperative Therapy)</strong><br />Chemotherapy or hormone therapy used as a first treatment. Often used for large or locally-advanced cancers to shrink tumors before surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Neoplasia</strong><br />Abnormal growth.</p>
<p><strong>Neoplasm</strong><br />Excess number of cells in a mass that can be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).</p>
<p><strong>Nested Case-Control Study</strong><br />A case-control study done within a prospective cohort study. The major advantage of a nested case-control study over a regular case-control study is the exposure of interest (for example, diet or alcohol use) is measured before any of the participants have disease, making it less subject to bias.</p>
<p><strong>Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy</strong><br />A breast reconstruction procedure that removes the tumor and margins as well as the fat and other tissue in the breast, but leaves the nipple and areola intact.</p>
<p><strong>Node-Negative (Lymph Node-Negative)</strong><br />Cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes. See Lymph Node Status in <a href="L.html">L</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Node-Positive (Lymph Node-Positive)</strong><br />Cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. See Lymph Node Status in <a href="L.html">L</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Invasive</strong><br />1. In treatment, describes a procedure that does not penetrate the skin (or any body opening) with a needle or other instrument.<br />2. In breast cancer pathology, describes a cancer that has not spread beyond the ducts or lobules where it began (see Carcinoma in Situ).</p>
<p><strong>Nonpalpable</strong><br />Describes a breast lump or abnormal area that cannot be felt but can be seen on an imaging test (such as a mammogram).</p>
<p><strong>Normal Tissue</strong><br />Cells that are cancer-free.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Medicine Imaging of the Breast (Molecular Breast Imaging)</strong><br />A technique under study for use in the early detection of breast cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging uses short-term radioactive agents given through an IV. Cancer cells absorb these agents and can be imaged with a special camera. Nuclear medicine imaging is not a standard breast cancer screening tool. Breast-specific gamma imaging and scintimammography are types of nuclear medicine imaging.</p>
<p><strong>Nucleus</strong><br />The part a cell that contains the genetic material DNA. Nuclei is the plural of nucleus.</p>
