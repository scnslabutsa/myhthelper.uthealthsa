<h1 class="title">Muscle Cramps</h1>
</div>
<p>Muscle cramps are painful contractions of one or more of your muscles. Talk to your healthcare team about frequent cramping, because your doctor may be able to prescribe a medication that can help you.</p>
<p>Tips for Managing Muscle Cramps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stretch and massage. Stretch the cramped muscle and gently rub it to help it relax.</li>
<li>Apply heat or cold. Use a warm towel or heating pad on tense or tight muscles, or take a warm bath. If heat doesn’t work, try applying a cold towel or wrap ice in a towel and gently rub the cramped muscle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips to Prevent Muscle Cramps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay hydrated. Fluids help your muscles contract and relax, so it’s important to avoid dehydration. A common recommendation is 8-10 cups of clear fluids per day.</li>
<li>This is especially important after strenuous physical activity or on days you spend a lot of time outdoors.</li>
<li>Stretch before and after physical activity.</li>
<li>Stretch before bed if you tend to have cramps at night.</li>
<li>Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime, can also prevent cramps while you’re sleeping.</li>
</ul>
