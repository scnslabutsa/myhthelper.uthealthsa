</div>
<p>Hormone therapy is often used after surgery (called “adjuvant therapy” that follows the primary treatment) to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is started before surgery (called “neoadjuvant therapy” that is a first step before the main treatment). It is usually used for 5 to 10 years.</p>
<p>Hormone therapy can also be used to treat cancers that have come back after treatment or that have spread to other parts of the body.</p>
