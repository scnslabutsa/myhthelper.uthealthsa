<p><strong>Lactation</strong><br />The process of producing milk and breastfeeding a child.</p>
<p><strong>Large Veins (Deep Veins)</strong><br />The large veins deep inside the legs that carry blood from the legs back to the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Late-Stage Cancer (see Metastatic Breast Cancer in <a href="M.html">M</a>)</strong><br /> <strong>Lesion</strong><br />Area of abnormal tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime Risk</strong><br />The chance of developing a disease (like breast cancer) over the course of a lifetime (usually defined as birth up to age 85). For example, the lifetime risk of breast cancer for women is 1 in 8 (or about 12 percent). This means for every 8 women, one will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime (up to age 85).</p>
<p><strong>Linear Accelerator</strong><br />The device used during radiation therapy to direct X-rays into the body.</p>
<p><strong>Liver Scan</strong><br />An image of the liver that can show the presence or absence of a tumor.</p>
<p><strong>Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS, Lobular Neoplasia in Situ)</strong><br />A condition where abnormal cells grow in the lobules of the breast. LCIS increases the risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Lobular Neoplasia in Situ (see Lobular Carcinoma in Situ)</strong><br /> <strong>Lobules</strong><br />Ball-shaped sacs in the breast that produce milk.</p>
<p><strong>Local Anesthetic</strong><br />Anesthesia that only numbs the tissue in a certain area. See Anesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>Local Treatment</strong><br />Treatment that focuses on getting rid of the cancer from a certain (local) area. In breast cancer, the local area includes the breast, the chest wall and lymph nodes in the underarm area (axillary nodes). Local treatment for breast cancer includes surgery with or without radiation therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Localized Breast Cancer</strong><br />Cancer that is contained in the breast and has not spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes or other organs.</p>
<p><strong>Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (Stage III Breast Cancer)</strong><br />Cancer that has spread beyond the breast to the skin or chest wall, but not to distant organs like the lungs or liver. It also refers to a tumor that is larger than five centimeters (about two inches) in size.</p>
<p><strong>Local Recurrence (Recurrence)</strong><br />The return of cancer to the same breast or to the same side chest wall.</p>
<p><strong>Lump</strong><br />Any mass in the breast or elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Lumpectomy (Breast Conserving Surgery)</strong><br />Surgery that removes only part of the breastâ€”the part containing and closely surrounding the tumor.</p>
<p><strong>Lymph Nodes (Lymph Glands)</strong><br />Small groups of immune cells that act as filters for the lymphatic system. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the underarms, groin, neck, chest and abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Lymph Node Status</strong><br />Shows whether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node- positive means that cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node- negative means that cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes. See Lymph Nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Lymphatic System</strong><br />The network of lymph nodes and vessels in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Lymphedema</strong><br />Swelling due to poor draining of lymph fluid that can occur after surgery to remove lymph nodes or after radiation therapy to the area. Most often occurs in the upper limbs (arm, hands or fingers), but can occur in other parts of the body.</p>
