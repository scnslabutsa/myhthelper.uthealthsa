<p><strong>Deductible (Insurance Deductible)</strong><br />The pre-set amount of medical costs a person must pay before insurance payments begin.</p>
<p><strong>Definitive Surgery</strong><br />All of the known tumor is removed and no follow-up surgery is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetic Mastopathy</strong><br />A rare benign (not cancer) breast condition that consists of small hard masses in the breast. It occurs most often in women with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br />Identification of a disease from its signs and symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Mammogram</strong><br />A mammogram used to check symptoms of breast cancer (such as a lump) or an abnormal finding noted on a screening mammogram or clinical breast exam. It involves two or more X-ray views of the breast.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Radiologist (Radiologist)</strong><br />A health care provider who specializes in the diagnosis of diseases using X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>Diploid (DNA Ploidy)</strong><br />The presence of a normal number of chromosomes in cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong>Disease-Free Survival Rate</strong><br />Percent of people alive and without disease at a certain time (often five years or 10 years) after treatment Those who die from causes other than the disease under study are not included in this measure.</p>
<p><strong>Distant Recurrence (see Metastases) DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)</strong><br />The information contained in a gene.</p>
<p><strong>Dose-Dense Therapy</strong><br />Chemotherapy given over a shorter (more condensed) time period compared to standard therapy. The frequency of treatment sessions is increased, so the length of the treatment period is shortened.</p>
<p><strong>Down-Staging</strong><br />Lowering the stage of a cancer from its original stage (or the stage it was thought to be). Down-staging occurs most often after a good response to neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is chemotherapy or hormone therapy used as a first treatment (before surgery) for some large or advanced breast cancers. Neoadjuvant therapy can shrink a tumor such that it lowers the stage of the breast cancer and a lumpectomy, instead of a mastectomy, can be done.</p>
